# uav_flight_geometry
This project aims at defining and creating the operational volume and the ground buffer risk for UAV operations.

The mathematical formulas are taken from the guidelines done by the LBA: https://www.lba.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/B/B5_UAS/Leitfaden_FG_CV_GRB_LUC.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=7

Thanks to this code, the flight geography and the contingency volume are easily calculated, saving a lot of time when applying for SORA.
